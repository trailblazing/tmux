# tmux

The goal of this dedicated library is to simplify the complexity of the interface between tmux and nvim.

It does this by eliminating the overlapping areas between tmux and nvim in the definition of shortcut keys.

The relevant programs must be used in conjunction with tmux.nvim. For detailed deployment documents, see [tmux.nvim](https://github.com/trailblazing/tmux.nvim)

Terminal multiplexers and editor families are important infrastructure for programmers. This library is just an attempt and demonstration of related issues -- any questions, improvements, forks, rewrites, and bug reports related to it are very welcome. Sincerely look forward to your participation in the [network community](https://t.me/tmuxer) on related topics:)
